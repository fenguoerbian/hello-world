# hello-world
The start of learning and using github

This sentence has been added here due to the request of the Github Guide.
Also it askes me to tell a bit about my self.
Actually, there's not much to say.

# Update on 02/23/2017
Again I'm trying to use github after dropping it for more than 1 year. Now I'm trying to record most of my study/work/life here. I hope I can learn more by using github more. For example I'm learning
* Markdown/rmarkdown/github markdown
* github pages/jekyll
* coding in R/Matlab/C/python
Hope I can pull them off.
